This project derives from https://github.com/ec-/Quake3e and https://github.com/inolen/quakejs.

Go to [Releases](../../releases) section to download latest binaries for your platform.

The feature list has become so long that I needed separate README files to describe each piece. This list will only have a short, truncated description with links to the other read-mes.

More on what makes WebAssembly [difficult to build here](./docs/quakejs.md#reasons-i-quit-working-on-this).

This is not a cheat server. There are experimental features that can be used to make "cosmetic" improvements. For example, the UNCHEAT mod is for moving the weapon position (e.g. `cg_gunX`) on mods that support weapon positioning but have the settings marked as CVAR_CHEAT. But I think we can agree that the position of the gun on **my** screen isn't affecting **your** ability to score against me. Variables that are unCHEAT protected are sent to server administrators for filtering/temporary blocking. The server kindly asks the player to re-add the CHEAT protection in order to play.

## New Features

  * [WebAssembly build mode](./docs/quakejs.md)
  * [Lazy loading](./docs/lazyloading.md)
  * [Server-side demos](./docs/demos.md)
  * [Multiworld, multi-map loading](./docs/multiworld.md)
  * [Lightning Network bitcoin transactions](./docs/payments.md)
  * [Procedural map generation](./docs/procedural.md)
  * [Multiple game styles](./docs/games.md)
  * [Slim client/auto connect and more](./docs/client.md)
  * [Referee, persistent sessions, event system](./docs/server.md)
  * WebAssembly build target without Emscripten
  * PNG support
  * Drag and drop
  * Many, many bug fixes

## Coming soon!
  
  * Multi-world file-system.
  * demoMap rendering that maps a .dm file to a surface in game.
  * Advanced teleporting features like replacing Voids with teleporting back, addressable spawn points.
  * Convert entire build system to even more agnostic C# than UE5, this is getting silly.

## Future TODOs

  * Authenticated clients
  * Always on twitch.tv streaming at no expense to the game server
  * Copy kubernetes support https://github.com/criticalstack/quake-kube
  * Asynchronous rendering for portals, mirrors, demos, videos, multiple maps, etc
  * Make a simple thread manager https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7269709/sending-information-with-a-signal-in-linux or use oneTBB as an alternative?
  * Move more features like EULA, etc out of JS and in to C system.
  * Quake 3 1.16n and dm3 integrated support from https://github.com/zturtleman/lilium-arena-classic.
  * IN FAILURE: HTML and CSS menu renderer with RmlUI
  * IN FAILURE: webm/VPX/vorbis video format, SVG, GIF

## Console

See the console commands from ioq3 https://github.com/ioquake/ioq3#console

Some client variables have been set by default for compatibility, those are listed here:

## TODO (in this repo): User Story

* The player opens the web interface and navigate to a map called "Guns, Lot's of Guns"
* The player is teleported into an all white room with shelves oriented radially so 
   each isle can be walked down towards the center of the circle. Parallel 
   with each other but wider at the far side of the shelf to form a circle.
   Morpheus is standing in the center next to an arm-chair and an old fashioned
   television set. 
* When the player touched the television they are teleported
   to a city rooftop like Superman from UrT4. 
* When the player jumps off the roof to
   follow Morpheus the player falls, see the world around fall to pieces like
   [You'll Shoot Your Eye Out](https://lvlworld.com/votes/id:2238). 
* The player is then teleported to the Dojo Q3 map.
* The player moves the browser window out of the recording to reveal another window of
   a television set zoomed in so you can't see the borders. It shows 4 screens
   of a time delay from the previous 30 seconds of all the rooms the player recently passed 
   through. 
* It slowly pans backwards to reveal the televition set and DVR system.
   Behind the television set a figure begins to appear, the logo style like at the
   [end of the Quake 3 Intro](https://youtu.be/Rgps2D3LptY?t=72) begins to appear 
   but instead of Quake III, it says Enter The Matrix. 
* When the words become obvious, Agent Smith's head 
   begins to appear from behind the television set controlled by another player remotely.
* All players can navigate all 4 worlds, The loading room for weapons, the sky-scraper city,
   the dojo and Agent Smith's monitor (Camera's Lots Of Camera's) should be laid out like 
   the Guns map but with cameras set to view-point of every entity.

## TODO (just thought of another): User Story

* The point of the game-play is to Stick Together (tm). The engine periodically forms bridges between
   all players occupying the same universe. 
* If there are 12 "maps", every player starts by choosing another player to spawn from, the first player
   in a world only chooses from a single point.
* The player might cross a field and battle bots through a forest and navigate a boat down stream without
   crashing against the sides, or fighting enemy projectiles. But at the end of the day, the person you
   spawn from is only a few steps away. 
* Nights and Winters must be navigated with another person, so a player can play for 30 minutes until the
   game turns to night, and then they must send an invite link to their friend to spawn with them.
* Some puzzles require many players to solve, so more opportunity for community growth.
* The game is won, "generally", by solving a puzzle that allows the player to cross dimensions to one
   of the other 10 universes. Becoming a multi-dimensional being eventually allows the player to travel
   between all dimensions.
* On a celestial scale, an RPG game is played by recruiting players to control the bodies of other players
   generated through their life-death cycle, naturally beating the game. The souls can be collected by 
   navigators viewing the universe from a birds-eye view and using them in a multi-versal battle.
   I.e. Civilizations X-style with an automatic human / food resource. >:D
* In the inter-dimensional being RPG mode, there is not "winning" only quotas to meet. Money to be made,
   add-ons to be sold, player's time to be collected on your behalf. "Soul" resources can be delegated and 
   traded with other players.
* Clearly this would take some orchestration for scripts to run to form bridgets, coordinating logins to
   put friends with links in the same servers, etc. 
* Playing the builder could even involve contributing coded parts to a universe.


Not all these "User Story" features are suitable for Q3e specifically, hence breaking up the repository into separate parts.
